<H1> <b> PMS - JOURNAL </b> </H1> 
<H3> DAY 1 - (22/05/2025) - 1 HOUR </H3>
Today I basically spend my day thinking about the idea for this custom project. It isn't my best idea, but I think it's a realistic one to start with (I may do a second and better one after this project). As I was saying, I just had the idea I want to work on, and I thought about the details.

<br>
To sum up, I want to create a small-form-factor cube with a i2c screen and a couple of sensors (BME280 and a CO<sub>2</sub> one) to show the data on screen. I'm thinking about a GPS antenna to track position and time. All the information will be saved on a SD Card with up to 90 days of storage in a .csv format. I could also add a solar panel to charge the Li-Po battery.

I will only count 1h for today's work as I was thinking during lecture hours and not 100% focused on it.
