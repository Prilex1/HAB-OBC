<H1> <b> PMS - JOURNAL </b> </H1> 
<H3> DAY 1 - (22/05/2025) - 1 HOUR </H3>
Today I basically spend my day thinking about the idea for this custom project. 
<br> 
<br>
To sum up, I want to create a light-weight pcb with all the essential components to launch a weather balloon with the capability to add more sensors using the remaning pins.

I will only count 1h for today's work as I was thinking during lecture hours and not 100% focused on it.
